**[Link to Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/amiingholami/medical-ml-project)**  


In this project, various solutions and methodologies were tested for predicting the likelihood of heart attacks using a medical dataset. The dataset comprises essential features such as age, sex, exercise angina, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, and other clinical indicators.

### Objectives:

  • Data Preprocessing: The initial phase involved cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical formats for analysis.
  
  • Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the relationships between different features and the target variable to uncover patterns and insights that could enhance model performance.
  
  • Model Development: Implementing a range of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to find the most effective model for predicting heart attack occurrences.
  
  • Model Evaluation: Assessing the models’ performances using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score to identify the best-performing solution.
  

### Outcome:

Through rigorous testing of different approaches, a satisfactory prediction model was achieved that accurately estimates the risk of heart attacks. This model serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals and individuals seeking to understand their heart health better.

**[Link to Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/amiingholami/mall-customer-segmentation-clustering)**  

The Mall Customer Segmentation & Clustering project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify distinct segments within a shopping mall. The goal is to understand customer behavior and preferences, which can inform marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

### Objectives:

	•	Data Acquisition: The project begins with the collection of customer data, including demographics, spending scores, and annual income.
	•	Data Preprocessing: This step involves cleaning the dataset by handling missing values and normalizing numerical features to prepare it for analysis.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting a thorough analysis of the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into customer behavior and spending habits.
	•	Clustering Techniques: Implementing various clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, to group customers based on their similarities in spending behavior and demographics.
	•	Model Evaluation: Evaluating the clustering results using metrics like silhouette score and inertia to determine the optimal number of clusters and assess the effectiveness of the segmentation.

### Outcome:

The project successfully segments customers into distinct groups, providing valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors. These segments can be leveraged by marketing teams to tailor campaigns, enhance customer experiences, and ultimately drive sales and loyalty within the mall.

## 4. Recommendation System for IMDB Movies
**[Link to Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/amiingholami/recommendation-system-for-imdb-movies)**  

The Recommendation System for IMDB Movies project aims to develop a robust and efficient system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. By leveraging data science techniques, the project seeks to enhance user experience on movie platforms, guiding viewers to films they are likely to enjoy.

### Objectives:

	•	Data Collection: The project begins with gathering a comprehensive dataset from IMDB, which includes movie titles, genres, ratings, user reviews, and other relevant attributes. This dataset serves as the foundation for building the recommendation system.
	•	Data Preprocessing: The collected data undergoes cleaning and preprocessing. This includes handling missing values, normalizing ratings, and transforming categorical variables (e.g., genres) into a suitable format for analysis. The goal is to ensure high-quality data for effective modeling.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through EDA, various insights about the dataset are uncovered. This includes understanding user demographics, popular movie genres, and the relationship between ratings and reviews. Visualizations are employed to present findings, helping to identify trends and patterns.
	•	Building the Recommendation Model: The core of the project lies in developing the recommendation system. Various techniques are explored, including:
	•	Collaborative Filtering: This method leverages user behavior to recommend movies based on similar users’ preferences. By analyzing user-item interactions, the system identifies movies that users with similar tastes enjoyed.
	•	Content-Based Filtering: This approach recommends movies based on the attributes of the items themselves. For example, if a user enjoyed action films, the system suggests other action movies with similar features (like cast, directors, or themes).
	•	Hybrid Model: Combining both collaborative and content-based filtering techniques provides a more comprehensive recommendation. This model takes advantage of the strengths of each approach, improving the overall accuracy of recommendations.
	•	Evaluation Metrics: The effectiveness of the recommendation system is assessed using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics help gauge the system’s performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Outcome:

The final output of this project is a fully functional recommendation system that provides users with personalized movie suggestions. Users can input their favorite films or ratings, and the system will respond with tailored recommendations that match their interests.

### Applications:

The developed recommendation system can be integrated into movie streaming platforms, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. By guiding users to relevant content, the system can increase viewership and retention rates, ultimately driving platform success.

# Analysis Data that extract from one of best libraries


# Stroke Prediction Project üöÄ

Welcome to the **Stroke Prediction Project**! This is a collaborative effort by a team of passionate data scientists who decided to come together and tackle a meaningful and ambitious project aimed at enhancing healthcare.

---

### üìç **Our Mission**
Our goal is to develop an AI model that can accurately predict the risk of stroke. Initially, this project was intended as a hands-on data science practice, but once the idea was sparked, it quickly evolved into something far more impactful. We're driven to create a tool that can be integrated into the medical field, providing valuable insights and possibly saving lives.

## üîç **Project Overview**

Our approach to the **Stroke Prediction Project** includes several phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Use the current [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) to build a strong initial model. This dataset offers key patient health metrics for preliminary testing.

2. **Phase 2**: Introduce real-world data, enhancing the model‚Äôs predictive power. We aim to incorporate patient data that reflects broader, more diverse demographics.

3. **Phase 3**: Expand to incorporate brain scan images through **image processing techniques**. By analyzing scans, we aspire to add a new dimension to the model, boosting both accuracy and reliability.

Our endgame is to contribute something truly meaningful to healthcare: an advanced tool capable of providing early stroke risk assessment.

## Time Series Forecasting: Parameters and Features

As part of my internship, I was assigned a task to **search about time series forecasting parameters and features**. 

For this, I studied the notebook available at the following link:

[Intro to Time Series Forecasting Notebook](https://github.com/AmiinGholami/MyInternship/blob/main/Week%202/1.%20Search%20about%20time%20series%20forecasting%20parameters%20and%20features/intro-to-time-series-forecasting.ipynb)

The notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to time series forecasting, covering the key parameters and features involved in this technique. This research helped me understand essential concepts like trend, seasonality, autocorrelation, and the importance of features such as lagged values and rolling statistics in building effective time series models.

Feel free to check it out!

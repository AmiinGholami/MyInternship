## Introduction

Predicting cryptocurrency prices is a challenging task due to high volatility and dynamic trends. In this project, we utilize supervised machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), to create an optimized model capable of forecasting Ethereum prices.

## Dataset Details

- **Source:** Historical Ethereum price data.
- **Features:**
  - `date`: Timestamp of the record.
  - `open`: Opening price of Ethereum.
  - `high`: Highest price of Ethereum for the day.
  - `low`: Lowest price of Ethereum for the day.
  - `close`: Closing price of Ethereum.
  - `volume`: Trading volume.

## Project Steps

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and formatted date/time fields.
   - Converted `Timestamp` data to numerical format to address errors.
   - Normalized features for better performance.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized price trends using line plots.
   - Analyzed distributions using histograms and boxplots.
   - Checked correlations between features.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Derived new features like daily returns and moving averages.
   - Selected relevant features to reduce noise.

### 4. **Model Implementation**
   - Implemented multiple algorithms:
     - **Decision Tree (DT):** Initial implementation to understand data behavior.
     - **SVM:** Enhanced model performance with kernel optimizations.
     - **LSTM:** Focused on temporal dependencies in data.

### 5. **Model Optimization**
   - Tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search and Cross-Validation.
   - Applied early stopping to prevent overfitting.

### 6. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 1.39
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 16.53
   - **R-squared (RÂ²):** 0.9997

## Model Performance

Our final model achieved outstanding performance:
- **Optimized Model Metrics:**
  - Mean Absolute Error: `1.39`
  - Mean Squared Error: `16.53`
  - R-squared: `0.9997`

This performance indicates high accuracy in predicting Ethereum prices. However, additional testing on unseen datasets is recommended to validate generalization.
